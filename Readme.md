The YCM Extra Configuration
===========================

As I am using [YCM](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe "YouCompleteMe") as text
auto completion plugin for my VIM and  I don't like to have a ".ycm_extra_conf.py" for
every project I am working on, I decided to write a global configuration which is loaded
for every project.


The main purpose of this file is to be able to serve as many projects as possible.
Therefore multiple formats to specify compiler flags are supported.


Supported Formats
=================

1. Clang Compile Commands
-------------------------
A very powerful format is the clang compile commands database saved in the
"compile_commands.json" file. This is a file which can be generated for your
project using cmake. The file then contains for each source file in your
projects the exact flags to compile them.


2. Clang Complete
-----------------
Clang Complete is another text auto completion plugin for VIM which I used
before YouCompleteMe. This plugin comes with its own configuration file saved
for each of your projects. These files (named ".clang_complete") are easy to
parse because they simply contain a newline separated list of flags used to
compile the project.


Parse Algorithm
================

This configuration file will try to find any of the in the supported formats section specified
files. The search will start in the folder where the currently edited file is located. If none
of the configuration files are found, the parent directory is checked next. This continues
until the root directory of the file system. The routine will look for the file formats in the
order they are listed above. If none of them are found, a default list of flags is used.


Usage
=====

Manual Installation
-------------------

If you want to use this configuration file with your YCM plugin, copy the "ycm_extra_conf.py"
file to your preferred location and add the following option to your ".vimrc".

```vimrc
    let g:ycm_global_ycm_extra_conf = path_to_your_conf_here
```

And that's it. Now you can use the listed flag formats in your projects without any hassle.

Automatic Installation
----------------------

Alternatively you can simply add the following line to your vimrc file if you are using like me
Vundle and let the plugin arrange everything.

```vimrc
    Plugin 'alexgby/ycmconf'
```
